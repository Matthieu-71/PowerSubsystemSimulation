# PowerSubsystemSimulation
For Summer 2018 spacecraft power susbystem simulation

Remember to test any code before adding it to this repository, this means inputting normal, extreme, and out of range values to check the behaviour of scripts. 

## Using SciLab 5.5.2 and the following toolboxes

  STL Files : https://fileexchange.scilab.org/toolboxes/490000
  
  CelesLab : https://atoms.scilab.org/toolboxes/celestlab
  
## Purpose of files :

  CelestLabExampleOrbitSim.sce : has examples of code that we could use from celestLab
  
  EarthOrbiterSystem.sce : this is the script that plots the orbit of the object around the Earth 
  
  ErrorRepository.md : database of errors users can encounter
  
  cube.stl and humanoid.stl : these are STL files that can be used for testing, the first is in binary and the second in ascii
